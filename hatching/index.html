      <h3>Items you’ll need:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>A lamp or similar direct light heat source</li>
        <li>3/16″ Rigid Airline Tubing (Length: 12″)</li>
        <li>Two Water Bottles</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>Cut bottles along the lines. You can repurpose the water inside the bottles to hatch your moina and fairy shrimp eggs. If using tap water, use a water conditioner to remove chlorine. These are freshwater invertebrates. DO NOT USE AQUARIUM SALT!</p>

      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>Assemble hatchery</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Place one bottle upside down inside the other. The bottom one will serve as the base. Fill your hatchery with 1/3 of spring water. The weight will help keep your hatchery from tilting over.</li>
        <li>Connect one end of the flexible air tubing to the air pump and the other one to the rigid air tubing.</li>
        <li>Place rigid air tubing inside your hatchery and turn on your air pump.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p>Prepare and hatch the eggs</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep fairy shrimp / moina eggs warm. Put under sunlight under a light bulb for 3-4 hours or about two hours. Afterward, put the eggs into bottled spring or fresh water from your tank. Use dechlorinated water only, and soak for 8-24 hours to absorb enough water.</li>
        <li>After 8-24 hours, oxygenate water using an air stone connected to an air pump (Open to low oxygen), turn on the lamp, and place it right on top of your hatchery – Do not turn the lamp off until the eggs have hatched.</li>
        <li>It will take 1-2 days before the eggs hatch for fairy shrimp and about 3-10 for moina, but it may take up to 16 days if conditions are not optimal. After that, start feeding food two times a day, and you may feed dry yeast and/or spirulina one teaspoon at a time. Please don’t add more food to the water if you notice the water looks cloudy and is still uneaten.</li>
        <li>Keep the water level steady by adding more spring water as the tank evaporates. After six to eight weeks, the fairy shrimp / moina will die off.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Keeping eggs that have not hatched</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After nine days, you can collect the eggs they have produced by suctioning the sediments off the bottom of the container (Eggs will look like tiny grains of brown sand).</li>
        <li>Unhatched eggs must be soaked in a freshwater container for two weeks.</li>
        <li>After two weeks, use the included filter to separate the eggs from the water. Then leave them in sunlight or air the eggs dry.</li>
        <li>Keep eggs in a zip lock bag and store them in a cool, dry place. Eggs can be stored for one year (but the longer you keep them, the hatching rate decreases).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you run out of food, you can use established aquarium freshwater, about 5-10 teaspoons, to feed the fairy shrimp / moina.</li>
        <li>The first hatch of fairy shrimp / moina is tiny, and they may not be visible.</li>
        <li>If the eggs do not hatch or the hatching percentage is less, you must dry them and use the method “Keeping eggs that have not hatched” again.</li>
      </ul>
