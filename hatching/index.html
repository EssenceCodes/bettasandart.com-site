      <h2>Build your hatchery</h2>
      <h3>Items you’ll need:</h3>

      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="img/item1.jpg" alt="Aquarium air pump">
        <img src="img/item2.jpg" alt="3/16″ flexible airline tubing">
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>A lamp or similar direct light heat source</li>
        <li>3/16″ Rigid Airline Tubing (Length: 12″)</li>
        <li>Two Water Bottles</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>
        Cut bottles along the lines. You can repurpose the water inside the bottles to hatch your moina and fairy shrimp eggs.
        If using tap water, use a water conditioner to remove chlorine. These are freshwater invertebrates. <strong>DO NOT USE AQUARIUM SALT!</strong>
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>Assemble hatchery:</p>

      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="img/step2a.jpg" alt="Hatchery assembly image 1">
        <img src="img/step2b.jpg" alt="Hatchery assembly image 2">
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Place one bottle upside down inside the other. The bottom one will serve as the base. Fill your hatchery with 1/3 of spring water. The weight will keep it stable.</li>
        <li>Connect flexible air tubing to the air pump, then to the rigid air tubing.</li>
        <li>Place rigid tubing inside your hatchery and turn on your air pump.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p>Prepare and hatch the eggs:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Warm the eggs under sunlight or a light bulb for 2–4 hours. Then soak them in bottled spring water or dechlorinated freshwater for 8–24 hours.</li>
        <li>Oxygenate the water with an air stone and turn on a lamp placed directly over the hatchery. Keep the light on until the eggs hatch.</li>
        <li>Fairy shrimp hatch in 1–2 days. Moina hatch in 3–10 days (sometimes up to 16 if conditions are poor). Feed twice daily using dry yeast and/or spirulina — only add more food once previous food is eaten.</li>
        <li>Keep water level stable by topping off with spring water. After 6–8 weeks, the colony will naturally die off.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Keeping unhatched eggs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>After nine days, collect the new eggs by suctioning sediment from the bottom. The eggs look like tiny grains of brown sand.</li>
        <li>Unhatched eggs must soak in freshwater for two weeks.</li>
        <li>After two weeks, filter the eggs, dry them in sunlight, and store them in a zip-lock bag in a cool, dry place.</li>
        <li>Eggs store for up to one year, but hatch rate declines over time.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tips</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>If you run out of food, you can use established aquarium freshwater (5–10 teaspoons) to feed them.</li>
        <li>Newly hatched fairy shrimp and moina are tiny and may be hard to see.</li>
        <li>If hatch rate is low, dry the eggs and repeat the “unhatched eggs” method.</li>
      </ul>
